# Devloping a Sport Betting Strategy
This is a project to develop a sports betting strategy and develop a ShinyApp to track and input sports bets, create dashboard of basic performance statistics, and find any potential insights in differnt analysts' projections. Currently I am just using FiveThirtyEight's NHL, NBA, NFL, and Club Soccer rankings to place bets, however would like to incorperate more analysts and compare performances.

## [FiveThiryEight](https://fivethirtyeight.com/)
*Background:* Started by [Nate Silber](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nate_Silver), his motivation for _FiveThirtyEight_ was to "analyze quantitative aspects of the political game to enlighten a broader audience." After much sucecss in predicting 49/50 states voting outcomes in 2008, he continues to presidential elections. Working as a baseball analyst before starting _FiveThirtyEight_, he has expanded his sports prediting scope to including: MLB, NBA, NFL, Global and Club Soccer (football), NHL, and many other sports tournaments suchs as March Madness.
Below you will find my methedology for betting with _FiveThirtyEight_'s predictions, specifically NBL, NFL, NHL, and slowly incorporating Club Soccer (football).
